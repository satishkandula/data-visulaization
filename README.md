# data-visulaization
credit card case study for data visualization
This is my first case study in machine learning
In this case study, apart from applying the techniques, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
The main aim of this project is to find insights from the data to make sure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
